# Serum

Serum is the means to make Jekyll useful.  Built on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), 
the bare bones needed to get started with Bootstrap, FontAwesome, and a Jekyll directory structure.  A 
helpful script has been added for creating posts that are timestamped with a title.  This is still a work
in progress, but I am shipping as things come out the other end.


Tenets:

* No frills
* No Plugins
* Lightweight

Keep to the essence of Jekyll, but add the missing structure to get started instead of porting from an
existing system.
